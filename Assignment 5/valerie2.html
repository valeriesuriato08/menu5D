		<div id="bodytextaffordances">- First recorded water bottle started as buffalo bladders
		<br>- Bladders of dead animals or animal horns were used to store water
		<br>- Started by the Romans to deliver water to cities
		<br>- Animal skins were also used to transport water in smaller portions
		<br>- Then, clay or mud used to carry water (Pottery) in 5000 BC</div>
		<div id="utilitytitle">Utility vs Aesthetics:</div>
		<div id="bodytextaffordances">- Water bottles has higher regard to usefulness rather than beauty
<br>- Used to hold liquid, ease transport of liquid from one place to another
<br>- Although, there are many bottle now that are designed for aesthetics</div>
<div id="affordancestitle">Affordances:</div>
		<div id="bodytextaffordances">- The shape, size and material all suggest how we are supposed to use it
<br>- Usually in a cylinder shape suggesting people to use hands to wrap around and pick it up
<br>- Small to medium size to fit in our hands or bags and others
<br>- Usually made of plastic so it is easier to see inside
<br>- Hollow inside for filling up
<br>- Grips on the cap for easier twisting to open and close
<br>- Lightweight material suggests use of transport
<br>- Existing lid suggests it can be filled up, transported without spilling
<br>- Affords to store other things that can seem to fit into the space</div>
<div id="constraintstitle">Constraints:</div>
		<div id="bodytextaffordances">- Material constraint as size of bottle allows it to hold only a certain amount (volume)
<br>- Size also suggests who can open the bottle, people with smaller hands find it difficult to twist or hold bottle
<br>- Material must be made of nonporous material so it can transport water and is durable long term to hold water for the time span needed to transport</div>
